Simrel is a user-friendly interface based on the Simrel R package, serving as a mobile and web application for simulations. It specializes in simulating multivariate linear model data, allowing users to define and customize various aspects of the simulation. The Simrel package includes four core functions—unisimrel, bisimrel, multisimrel, and simrel—for simulating univariate, bivariate, and multivariate linear model data. These functions offer flexibility in specifying correlations, relevant predictors, and other parameters. The unisimrel function focuses on univariate linear model data, while bisimrel extends this to bivariate data with options for correlation control. The package also provides additional functions for visualizing covariance and rotation matrices, as well as other properties of the simulated data. Simrel enhances user control in generating multivariate linear model datasets. Published: Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems. 2018, 176 1-10.
